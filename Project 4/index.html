        <h2>A Review of html</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of
          ordinary text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">"
          characters. The best part about HTML is that once we know how to
          effectively use basic elemts, we can look up how to use all of the
          others!

      <h3><u>Lists</u></h3>
      <p>
        Below is an example of a nested-list, using both an ordered list and an
        unordered list:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First</li>
        <li>Second</li>
        <li>Third</li>
        <ul>
          <li>3rd place</li>
          <li>Tres</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fourth</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div id="Links">
      <h3><u>Links</u></h3>
      <p>
        Links are very useful, and help users to quickly navigate to new pages,
        both within and outside of the current website
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, they can quickly direct users to
        <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"> Googles Homepage</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="mailto:eschiron@student.mamkschools.org"> Emails</a> can also
        be sent easily through the use of links
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="Top">
          They can even bring user to a certain place within a webpage
        </a>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="images">
      <h3><u>images</u></h3>
      <p>
        <img align="left" src="images/Tiger2.jpeg" /> Sometimes we want to go
        ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the
        "align" attribute, with a value "left" is a perfect way to do this. You
        could also align the picture to the right of text by replacing the value
        in the "align" attribute to "right".
